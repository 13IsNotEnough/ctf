Welcome to a new generation of CPUs!
We run on 48 bits, using 4 registers, relative addressing, cyclic memory,
and last but not least a customized instruction set.

The Gentoo handbook told me once:
1: READ EVERYTHING, don't skip around. don't skim the text, but do read the whole thing once to get an idea whats going on.
2: Use your brain! Stop and think about what its saying.
3: If you have a problem, try to solve it yourself.
The same goes for you.

The memory, (which will be called: board through this manual) will be
initialized with 0s. Then the CPU will load the programs, and start them in
an arbitrary order.

The general layout of the supported instructions is:
name_of_instruction destination source
if you feel like it you can also write:
name_of_instruction,destination,source;
or even:
name_of_instruction,,,,destination,,source;
Well, you get the idea. I will only use the first version, because it uses
less characters. Additionally, it is possible to write comments everything
after a semicolon will be ignored:
;Hi dear reader, I am a comment
same goes for //
//I am a comment, too!
You can use the special comments:
;name: $heregoesthenameofyourbot
;desc: here goes some description of your bot, to provide your bot with meta information

===Binary Layout===
Every memory cell (read: "every memory word") consists of 3 parts:
[op1] [op2] [cmd]
  20    20      6  Bits
While it is possible to use operands that are not needed by the instruction, it is
considered bad style and will most probably result in unexpected crashes. Do not use
additional operands for modifying additional values by means of post decrement/increment,
because this would result in ugly code.

=== Registers ===
There are four general purpose registers.
ptr - the pointer register
acc - the accumulator register
r1  - nameless register one
r2  - nameless register two

=== CPU flags ===
There are three flags that will be set by the CPU:
equal - will be set if the result of the last instruction was zero
above - will be set if the result of the last instruction was >zero
smaller - will be set if the result of the last instruction was <zero
The flag will be set for every instruction where it makes sense ;) For example
cmp, all arithmetic and logic operations

=== Mov instructions ===
mov dest src - move stuff from the source to the destination
mvp val unused - move stuff to the ptr register
mva val unused - move stuff to the acc register

=== Logic operations ===
xor dest src - dest xor src, the result will be saved to dest
and dest src - dest and src, the result will be saved to dest
or  dest src - dest or src, the result will be saved to dest
not dest unused - binary not on destination, the result will be saved to dest

=== Arithmetic operation ===
dec dest unused - decrement destination, save the result to dest
inc dest unused - increment destination, save the result to dest
neg dest unused - negate destination, save the result to dest
add dest src - add src to dest, the result will be saved to dest
sub dest src - sub src from dest, the result will be saved to dest
mul dest src - multiply dest and src, the result will be saved to dest
div dest src - divide dest by src, the result will be saved to dest
mod dest src - the remainder of the division dest/src, the result ...
ica unused unused - increment acc
dca unused unused - decrement acc
ada val unused - same as add acc val
sba val unused - same as sub acc val

=== Jmp instructions ===
jmp dest unused - continue execution at dest
jie dest unused - jmp if equal
jia dest unused - jmp if above
jis dest unused - jmp if smaller
jne dest unused - jmp if not equal
jna dest unused - jmp if not above
jns dest unused - jmp if not smaller

=== Important and useful other stuff ===
cmp src dest -compare the src and the destination, flags will be set
splt dest unused - create a new thread at dest
die unused unused - stop execution of this thread

=== Interrupts ===
The CPU has an interrupt vector containing three interrupts. The cpu has a hidden register containing the interrupt flags. If any of this flags is set, the cpu will jump to offset stored in the interrupt vector. If two or more interrupts are set, one instruction is executed in the first interrupt handler, than the next interrupt handler is called (you can use this instruction to disable the interrupt_enable flag). The interrupts are prioritised as following: First call Imem, then cza and finally cza.

sti unused unused - enable interrupts
cli unused unused - disable interrupts
rti unused unused - return from interrupt (does not work recursively)

The next instructions are used to set the interrupt vectors.
If the dest is 0 this interrupt is disabled
clk cycles dest - jumps to dest every #cycles, the #cycles must be >=4
mem addr dest - jumps dest whenever addr is changed
cza val dest -  jumps to dest if acc is equal to val

=== Labels ===
You can use labels to increase readability of your code.
:label - everything after a ":" will be a label (only [a-z] are allowed for
    labeling!
jmp @label - will jump to label
it is also possible to use @label in other context, just know that @label
holds the relative addr of :label

===Constants===
$constant=42 - defines a constant, with name constant and value 42, you can
now use it whenever needed (e.g. add ptr, $stepsize+2)

===Parameters===

a parameter looks like: /(*|**)?(number|register)[+\-]?/
example: mov r1   **3-

The binary layout of the parameters:
[type][value_type][value][op]
    2  1            16    2 Bit
type: 01=> direct (*ptr)  10=>indirect(**ptr)  11=> immediate (ptr)  00=> invalid
value_type: 1=>reg / 0=>constant value
op: 01=>inc  10=>dec  11=>noop  00=> invalid

===Debugging===
While writing your code you can use two different tools:
*Debugger
  First of all, use `ruby debugger.rb $yourbot $otherbot` to visualise the behaviour of the bots.
  This program is a graphical cpu emulator.
  Commands:
  * Space     - pauses/restarts emulation
  * Arrows / hjkl - move the cursor (the value under the cursor is shown in the lower part of the screen)
  * -/+     - increase/decrease the simulation speed
  * q       - exit emulation
  * n       - abort current simulation and restart
  * s       - single step through emulation

*Profiler
  Then evaluate the efficiency of your bot with `ruby profiler.rb $yourbot $otherbot`.
  This program will perform a huge number of games and tells you about the outcome.
===Deploying===
So you have written your Code, what now?

You will have to send the code the the server. To do that you have to use the bot_add script.
`ruby bot_add.rb $yourbot $server $username $password`
The server the tests the performance of your bot. The results will be shown on http://$server/scores.html.

===Setup===
install Ruby (1.8 and 1.9 work)
install ruby gems
install the ncurses and the parallel gem
(gem install ncurse && gem install parallel)
=> everything should work now (note, ncurses seems to be buggy - even the samples don't work on some machines -_-)
