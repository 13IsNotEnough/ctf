Welcome to the readme of the OfficeApp beta.

OfficeApp is the new way of doing all your office needs without having to
install complex software on every of your minion machines. All they have
to do is to connect to port 1234 on your server with the pre-installed
program `telnet`. Then every feature ever needed in any proper office is
available at your fingertips.

fault.

	manager and secretaries)

	(able to read, write and list your notes.)
